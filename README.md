# Modular Launcher 2.0
Skipping entirely past 1.0, I decided to rewrite my Modular Launcher from the ground up with new techniques I have acquired since the first version and with a couple of things I noticed I would have liked in the first version, but couldn't add without in turn breaking other things.
I also realised that I should probably have used version control of some sort, so here I am.

If you're interested in upgrading your Arma Launcher experience, keep an eye on the Releases section!

(Planned) Features over Modular Launcher 0.x/1.x:
* Localisation! Enjoy your Launching in at least twice the languages! (Plus more as people help me translate it. In other news, I'm looking for people that could contribute some translations!)
* Events! Mostly internal, but these will help improve consistency and stability overall!
* Centralised Settings! Tired of having a separate settings window for each plugin? Me too! That's why I'm putting them all into one!

And then you obviously still get:
* Modularity! Customise your Launcher with exactly the stuff you need!
* Accessibility! If the stuff you need can't be found, the tools to make it are available!
